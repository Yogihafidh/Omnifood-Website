# What i learning
- In terms of CSS, this project really taught me a lot! I came to understand how important flexboxes, grids, and media queries are for creating beautiful and responsive website designs. This was also my first time creating a design specifically for mobile and tablet display - and it was really fun to learn.
- For HTML, I learned why we should use semantic tags instead of just using divs everywhere. I also started to understand the basics of SEO and how to use the Google Lighthouse tool.
- In addition, I learned how to deploy a website to Netlify, as well as how to connect a personal domain with a deployed website. I also learned the basics of Open Meta Tags and Web Manifest so I could add logos to web-based applications on mobile devices.
